* The following page outlines the steps to create a burn severity classification model using drone dervied imagery. Access to code and ArcPro data is avaliable via this site. For access to orignial imagery sources please reach out to: maddiegillespie@ucla.edu for access as file sizes are too large to be hosted on this page.
