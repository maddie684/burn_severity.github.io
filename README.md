### Burn Severity Project Code: 

[Random Forest Burn Severity Classification Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/maddie684/burn_severity.github.io/blob/main/assets/data/Masters_GDAL_Attempt01.ipynb)

* The following page outlines the steps to create a burn severity classification model using drone dervied imagery. Access to code and ArcPro data is avaliable via this site. For access to orignial imagery sources please reach out to: maddiegillespie@ucla.edu for access as file sizes are too large to be hosted on this page.
